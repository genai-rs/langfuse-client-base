# Contributing to langfuse-client-base

This repository contains **auto-generated code** from the Langfuse OpenAPI specification. 

## ⚠️ Important Note

**Do not manually edit the generated code in `src/`**. All code is automatically generated and any manual changes will be overwritten during the next generation.

## Regenerating the Client

To update the client with the latest OpenAPI spec:

```bash
./scripts/generate-openapi-client.sh
```

## Reporting Issues

If you find issues with the generated client:
1. Check if it's an issue with the OpenAPI spec itself
2. Check if it's an issue with the generation process
3. Open an issue describing the problem
